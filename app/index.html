          <p class="DrukWide-Medium-Web" style="-webkit-margin-before:1em;">Transit Radio is a podcast radio station recorded at reception centers for asylum Seekers in Norway. The recordings are from workshops with asylum-seekers led by professional musicians. In addition there will be interviews with asylum seekers about what music they play while in transit and about what it means to them.</p>

          <p>What we want to achieve with this radio station is to inspire a sense of belonging in asylum seekers to a large community of expatriates and to music. Although away from home, they are not alone.  We hope to invite refugees into the idea that music and culture are arenas to make your protest heard. It is a way to communicate your feelings, make your position known, for freedom of expression and appreciation of music. We also hope that Norwegians will listen in and learn to appreciate the breadth of experience that life as an asylum seeker can be.</p>

          <p>Partners in this project are the musicians Abazar Hamid, Khaled Harara and Sheldon George Blackman. Peter Daatland at Frekvens is editor. Hilde Maisey is general manager at Transnational Arts Production (TrAP) and this radio´s managing editor.</p>

          <p>Transit Radio is a project for people in different stages of transit. We hope to build this larger project that will include recordings from refugee camps from around the world. We are seeking partners for this, please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:post@transitradio.no">post@transitradio.no</a> if you want to join us.</p>

          <section id="contributors">
            <h1>Contributors</h1>

            <h2>Sofia Bagge</h2>

            <p>Swedish freelance journalist, Sofia Bagge, has worked as a reporter, presenter and researcher in various TV- and radio productions for NRK and the Swedish national public radio, Sveriges Radio. Previously, she has been involved in <i>Salonghistorier</i>, arranged by the radio show <i>Salongen</i>, NRK P2– a concept inspired by the American podcast <i>The Moth</i> and in 2014 she produced two music documentaries. She is an editor and contributor at a web based platform for gender equality and a member of the independent Norwegian podcast collective <i>Frekvens</i>.</p>

            <h2>Khaled Harara</h2>
            <p>was born 1987 in Yemen. He is a renowned Palestinian hip-hop artist who has lived as a refugee in Gaza. His texts discuss the political situation in Palestine from a humanitarian and social perspective and criticize the lack of freedom of expression and the suffering in Palestine under the Hamas rule.</p>

            <p>In Gaza, Khaled Harara was the first to organize hip hop workshops for youth, focusing on writing texts and on different ways of expressing oneself. The workshops were banned, just like his group <i>Palestinian Unit</i> and the artist organization that he was a member of.</p>

            <p>As a result of his artistic expression, and his participation as a soldier of the PLO forces before Hamas took control of Gaza, Harara is considered an <i>enemy of the state</i>. More than once, he has been to prison, tortured and subject to rough interrogations, and several of his friends have been killed or injured in fights against Hamas.</p>

            <p>Khaled Harara was Gothenburg City of Refuge's guest writer from 2013 to 2015. During his stay in Gothenburg Khaled Harara has taken part in several public events, debates and workshops. He released two new singles with the jazz rock band <i>Makten & Härligheten</i> in May 2015.</p>

            <h2>Abazar A. Bagi Hamid</h2>
            <p>started singing for peace in Sudan at an early age, and formed his first band, <i>Balsam</i>, at university. In 1997, he became well-known at regional level when he joined <i>IGD ELGLAD</i>, and in 2005, he quit his job as an architect to start his solo career, launching the project <i>Rainbow Songs</i>. The project brought together musicians from across Sudan, aiming to slip lyrics about Human Rights and dignity past the music monitoring committee.</p>

            <p>In 2006 he worked with various organizations training traditional Arab Hakama singers – colloquially called Janjaweed singers – in Darfur. The idea behind the project was to convince the Hakama singers to take a more active part in the peace movement.</p>

            <p>Hamid released his first solo album, <i>Sabahak Rabah (Good Morning Home)</i> in 2007 but experienced increasing censorship in his home country. Songs dealing with the social and political issues riding Sudan were especially scrutinized, and after severe censorship and verbal threats, Abazar chose exile and moved to Cairo in 2008.</p>

            <p>In 2009 he established the project <i>Democratizing Music</i> in collaboration with other Sudanese and Egyptian musicians, as a forum to share resources rather than fighting each other. The project yielded several events and performances, and his song <i>Peace to Darfur</i> which had previously been censored in Sudan, was included and released as part of the <i>Listen to the Banned</i> CD.</p>

            <h2>Sheldon George Blackman</h2>
            <p>is a musician, singer and songwriter from the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago. He is currently employed at Torshov EMA where he teaches music.</p>

            <p>His music is best described as <i>Caribbean heart beat music!</i> expressions of Calypso, Soca, Reggae, Rapso and Jamoo fused with elements of jazz, blues and urban music. His natural love for music was recognized at an early age and nurtured by the expert hand of his father the late great Ras Shorty I, the creator of the musical genres of <i>Soca</i> and <i>Jamoo</i>.</p>

            <h2>Hilde Ghosh Maisey</h2>
            <p>is the general manager of Transnational Arts Production (TrAP), an independent art production company with an aim to increase diversity in Norwegian arts and culture. Previously she has worked as a photographer and founded an institute for applied conceptual art. Maisey has chaired FFF, the national organization for photographers and camera based artists in Norway and Fotogalleriet. Maisey has taught photography at Bergen National Academy of the Arts and at Elvebakken Upper Secondary School. She has written <i>Handbook of Political Influence</i>, that was part of Akershus Art Centre celebration of the Norwegian Constitution Bicentennial.</p>
